  summary: Determine if a distributed validator has been selected to make a sync committee contribution
  description: |
    Submit sync committee selections to a DVT middleware client. It returns the threshold aggregated sync 
    committee selection. This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as part of a distributed 
    validator cluster, and is implemented by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is 
    used to exchange partial selection proof slot signatures for combined/aggregated selection proofs to 
    allow a validator client to correctly determine if one of its validators has been selected to perform 
    a sync committee contribution (sync aggregation) duty in this slot. Consensus clients need not support 
    this endpoint and may return a 501.
